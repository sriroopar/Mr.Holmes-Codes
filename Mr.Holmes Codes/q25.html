            <h3>LOGIC</h3>
            <p>An array is squareful if the sum of every pair of adjacent elements is a perfect square.

                Given an integer array nums, return the number of permutations of nums that are squareful.
                
                Two permutations perm1 and perm2 are different if there is some index i such that perm1[i] != perm2[i]</p>

        <div id="div3">
            <h2>SAMPLE INPUT</h2>
            <p>nums = [1,17,8]</p>
        </div>
        <div id="div4">
            <h2>SAMPLE OUTPUT</h2>
            <p>2</p>
            <p>Explanation: [1,8,17] and [17,8,1] are the valid permutations.</p>
